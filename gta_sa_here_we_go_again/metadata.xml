    <description>In celebration of Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition [i](terrible name btw)[/i] releasing, I have created a mod that plays CJ's classic meme phrase from GTA San Andreas when starting/continuing a run.
	
[i]Ah shit, here we go again.[/i]

[b]Known Issues:[/b]
[*] Game may crash when loading first run after turning on mod while using steam cloud(is fine for subsequent times)
